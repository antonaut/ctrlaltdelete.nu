This post will be filled with spontaneous questions and answers
related to whether one should use an existing game engine or create
one from scratch.

**What budget are you on?** If I'm really low on a budget I'll probably
use an engine if it can save me some time we all know; Time is
money. The time saving aspect is also present when it comes to
maintaining the game and/or improving it. It is important that the
engine gives you a good workflow so you can easily work with it. A
good idea might be to implement some simple games/demos/ideas in the
few engines you are interested of and see which ever suits you the
best.

**Are you lacking a feature in the engine?** You can probably extend the
engine if it doesn't have all the features you require for a game
project. Also remember that there are several other engines to choose
from which might give you more features for free. This is obviously
something you should consider when you make the actual choice.

**What platforms should we target?**
Different engines allow us to target different platforms. This is
obviously an important choice to make as well. It is kind of connected
to the monetization issue. Do more platforms equal more profit?

**So, Anton since you're into web apps. What about them?**

Well, I personally really like the web, but I am not sure it is well
suited for everyone. John Carmack mentions in a keynote from QuakeCon
that he does not really believe in using javascript for high
performant graphics in the browser&nbsp;[^fn:1]. I am thinking that means
it would be hard to get a triple-A title running as smooth in the
browser as it does natively. However a lot of "smaller" games run
perfectly in the browser with great graphics. I remember specifically
when Supergiant Games released Bastion&nbsp;[^fn:2] on the Chrome Web
Store. Beautiful.
