I read [this](http://jessicaabel.com/2016/01/27/idea-debt/) article about idea debt. Not sure which affected me the
most. What she stated about idea investment, or the fact that she too
doesn't know how to use the french subjunctive correctly. Nonetheless,
I'm truly inspired to put my old ideas to the side and work with what
I've got at the moment. I want to start documenting stuff
properly. This is my blog. My life.
