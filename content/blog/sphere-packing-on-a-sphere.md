The idea of a tool giving you access to finding relevant papers in a
certain field of research is pretty interesting. Let's imagine all the
papers as a [planar graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planar%5Fgraph) depicted on a sphere. The edges
(arrows/links) of the graphs are keywords or subjects. A certain
'theme' (a set of papers) would then be a 'continent' on the sphere.

Imagine this thing spinning and showing you the papers you've found,
then expanding those with related papers - pushing the old papers
aside. Found an example done in 2D with d3.js for dependencies
<https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/7607535>. Would it be interesting to see
this in 3D? Maybe in an AR setting. The zooming effect would probably
come naturally if the spheres grow to big. I sort of like the concept
of several virtual globes for organizing stuff. Not so sure of how I
would feel about them in reality though.
