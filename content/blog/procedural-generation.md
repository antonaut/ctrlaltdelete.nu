I really think that map generation or procedural content generation is
something which is becoming more and more common in games. Instead of
playing linear, story based games we get to experience
multidimensional games where we create our own unique worlds (or have
our own worlds created for us). However, generating good maps is a
really difficult problem which really hasn't been available until more
recently so I think that there are many improvements to be made here
in the future.

I think we will see even more of this in the future. Perhaps a lot
more free-roaming, sandbox games like Minecraft, Terraria or perhaps
Project Zomboid&nbsp;[^fn:1] (video included since it's not that heard of and
'only' in beta). I think the procedural generation of content adds
greatly to the sandbox survival genre of games. These games often add
a bit of a RPG element to them, making it extra sad when your
heroine/hero dies.

Taking it one step further, I'd love to see what happens when not only
the maps are generated, but also the creatures within them. I imagine
something like Spore&nbsp;[^fn:2] for monsters/creatures in the
world. Perhaps someday one will be able to generate quests and dialogs
aswell. It all comes down to breaking it into small enough parts I
guess.

Hopefully we will se a lot more AR-/VR integration in games as
well. Games played on devices such as Oculus Rift, Google Glass and so
forth, are games I'm already greatly looking forward to, since
procedural creation might be very applicable to such scenarios. For
instance generating content based on whatever you are currently
looking at.
