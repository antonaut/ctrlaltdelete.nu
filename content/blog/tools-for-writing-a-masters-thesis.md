A master's thesis is an intense 18 weeks of total focus and devotion
to a research question. So far, I've only been able to invest about
one weeks worth of studies during a four week period. My personal life
is taking its toll on my work at the moment. I don't feel like it's
that frustrating, but I'd really like to get more stuff done.

In order to increase my productivity I've come up with a plan.

1.  Devote more time to planning in the morning
2.  Use a pomodoro (from _Italian:_ means tomato) timer when working to
    minimize distractions

To keep track of my pomodoros, I use a simple app called [Productivity
Challenge Timer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wlxd.pomochallenge).

These two simple things should allow me to plan the process more
smoothly.

Step one in the process of the thesis is to write a specification
document. The document should provide detailed information of the
following things:

-   The goals of the thesis, what I hope to achieve
    -   Why it is important
    -   To whom is it important
-   My own background and why I'm eligible to write it
-   The research question this thesis will try to explore and answer
-   A detailed timeplan for when everything should be done

Just like this blog, I'll largely write my thesis in [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) with
[org-mode](http://orgmode.org/). I've started to organize some of the references I've found
in [Mendeley Desktop](https://www.mendeley.com/) and in an org-mode file. I also found a nice
latex-package for doing gantt-charts called _pgfgantt_.
