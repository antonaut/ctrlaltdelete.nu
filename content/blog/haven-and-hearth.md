Today I played a game by originally made by Seatribe called Haven and
Hearth&nbsp;[^fn:1]. It's a MMORPG where death, Permanent death(!), is
imminent. The scenario takes place in a world quite similar to real
nature. There are no fictive elements in the game in that sense. It's
really like a simulation of a subset of the real world. Typically you
travel around in a forest of some sorts. There are mountains, rivers
and lakes for you to explore. I starved to death pretty early but on
my second character I managed to find some apple/hazel/mullberry
trees which I could forage for edibles.

Other than permadeath, another unique thing about this game is that
the world is dynamic. For instance can everything be razed and reused
much like in the real world. I think this adds a bit of spice to the
game, as MMORPGS tend to get very repetitive with new characters, as
you do the same types of quests over and over again.

In order to make it more enjoyable and so on, Seatribe have added a
quality system to the game. The quality systems gives value to the
items much like an in-game currency. All of the items have quality
values. If you combine items of different quality level, you get an
item with some weighted average quality.

Their business model is quite interesting. The game is F2P&nbsp;[^fn:2] and
doesn't focus on money making at all, which is quite a relief when
playing. No ads, no worries. In a sense, it can get very "zen" as you
stroll through the forest, enjoying the view. A meditation of sorts.
This is really a good game for whenever you feel like escaping reality.

I've never played a game like this before. I've only played MMORPG's
with a static world like Runescape&nbsp;[^fn:3]. Playing was really fun, I
managed to find my friend there and we chopped down some trees
together and built a simple shelter. Perhaps we should've played some
more, since we didn't get that far in the game.
