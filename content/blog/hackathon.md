A lot has happened since we started developing the game.
Our initial goal was to do these tasks during the hackathon:

-   WebSockets and API
-   TouchEvents
-   GameLoop and GameStates

Afterwards, we now have a somewhat working APICallSystem with Secure
WebSockets. Unfortunately havn't our exportation framework for Android
and iOS supported the wss protocol yet, but it'll hopefully be up and
running soon. During the hackathon I had a great time. We put up a
stream at Twitch.tv to stream everything while making tacos and
listening to jazz from a jar (using something similar to
[this](http://www.origaudio.com/shop/index.php?dispatch=products.view&product%5Fid=29778)).
