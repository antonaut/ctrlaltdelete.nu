We worked on this for a while, but it just ran out in the sand when I
went to France for exchange studies. Nevertheless, it was a great
learning experience for me. I think I mostly learned a bunch of
javascript. We built the client side of a somewhat advanced game. The
coolest part was a small window system built mostly by my friends in
WebGL.

Hopefully we can publish the code with some small examples.
