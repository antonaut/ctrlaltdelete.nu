Today we had a guest lecture from Per Strömbäck of Dataspelsbranchen,
the trade organization for Swedish game development. He wanted us to
discuss two specific questions which all in all are quite important
when it comes.

**How can the game developer interact with the audience?**

There are multiple ways of interacting with your target audience as a
game dev. The easiest to come up with are probably through public
forums, a wiki, social media and/or some other kind of web based
communcation. However, I think the most important interaction comes
from other settings though.

Perhaps you perform some usability tests on your game, meaning you
pick some testers and perform interviews of them. Perhaps you play the
game together with them and communicate through the game you have
made? Perhaps your dev studio attends fairs or arranges workshops of
different kinds (hackathons?), where you need to physically interact
with players etc.

Usually when it comes to games, there is always a lot of feelings
involved. Therefore I think it is really important to be honest with
what goals you have with the game and what purpose it has. Otherwise
you might end up having a really let-down playerbase since you
introduced PvP in starting towns and did not discuss it with your
player. Sure it is your game since you made it, but don't you have
some kind of responsibility towards your playerbase?

**Why does not in-game ads work?**

I think In-game ads don't work because the amount of time a player spends in a
game is minimal. At least when it comes to mobile games. I do think
in-app purchases are a lot better. At least if they are done in a good way.

British technology magazine Wired has released an article on in-app
purchases in Plants-vs-Zombies 2&nbsp;[^fn:1]. The article explains
extremly well how I think in-app purchases shouldn't work. I do not
think that in-app purchases should give the player any advantages
compared to when not having done them. I usually end up quitting these
games immediately since they ultimately favor the player with the
largest wallet. Which is insane.
