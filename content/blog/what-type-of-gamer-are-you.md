My name's Anton Erholt and I've just started my master's programme
in Computer Science at KTH. I'm 23 years old and live in a suburb of
Stockholm together with two of my friends.

I've been playing computer games for about as long as I can
remember. I remember the Christmas when I got my first console, the
Nintendo Game Boy&nbsp;[^fn:1] together with Super Mario Land&nbsp;[^fn:2].

Ever since then, I guess I've been kind of hooked on handheld
games. Somehow, I really prefer the compact format and (the usually)
somewhat simple controls. I can recall playing in the backseat of the
car as a kid almost every vacation trip we ever made.

Throughout the years, I've owned a few different handheld consoles,
mostly from the Nintendo series. IIRC, I currently own a Game Boy, a
Game Boy Advanced (GBA), a PlayStation Pocket (PSP) and well, no PS
VITA, but a PlayStation Certified smartphone&nbsp;[^fn:3]. Together with my
flatmate, we have some other consoles at home as well (NES, SNES, N64,
PS3, XBOX [original] and a&#x2026; Commodore 64!). As of right now I mainly
play on my smartphone or my PC if I play something.

My favorite genre of games usually varies a bit, but over the years I
seem to return to the single player RPG-genre. Games such as Golden
Sun&nbsp;[^fn:4], The Legend of Zelda: Links Awakening&nbsp;[^fn:5] and Final
Fantasy VII&nbsp;[^fn:6] are a few of my favorites. Another genre which I've
grown a bit attached to, is the roguelike, dungeon-crawling
genre. Permadeath, tons of monsters and weird actions. Dungeons of
Dredmor&nbsp;[^fn:7] is one of the games I'm currently playing a lot.

One of my greatest game experiences must have been while playing
Pokémon Blue&nbsp;[^fn:8], getting the 151st Pokémon. I remember being
extremely happy about having "Caught them all". The feeling was almost
indescribable after having spent so many hours completing that
task. Too bad it only took 'til a few months until they released about a
hundred more Pokémons in a new game.

One of the worst gaming experiences I've had was probably when I
played one of the Zenonia&nbsp;[^fn:9] games on my phone. The game was so focused
on trying to sell me stuff and incorporating ads that it was almost
unplayable. I uninstalled it very quickly since it wasn't that
fun. I'd rather had spent some money on buying the game instead of
having a f2p business model.

I've not got that much experience of developing games. My main
development work has been of web programming nature (part front-end,
part back-end), so this is a bit of a new field for me.
