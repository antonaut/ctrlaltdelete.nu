Over at [CodinGame](http://codingame.com) they have something called clashes of code where you
compete with other developers to solve a certain problem in a given
amount of time. I know there are quite a few sites where you can
sharpen your coding skills, but somehow I got stuck at this one. Maybe
it provides me with just enough challenge for me with my current skills.

I've tried to use the clashes to learn more about Clojure. So far I've
come to realize that there are a **TON** of functions I don't know of. I
feel like I learn something new on (almost) every problem. Even though
I can't finish most of them on time, I still try to complete them. I'll put
some of my solutions to a few of the more interesting solutions here.
