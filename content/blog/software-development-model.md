I think the model used to develop a game is really depending on what
type of game you make. I'd like to address the fact that not every
type of game needs to be high-end performing. As a guideline though,
whatever type of development model which allows you to be productive
is useful.

Do you have a ton of ideas which needs to be tested before you can
decide upon stuff? Like /u/RukiTanuki suggested on Reddit to the girl
making a science-based dragon MMO&nbsp;[^fn:1]; There are several ideas to
take into account.

The one i liked the most of his proposals is where he suggests that
you make some prototypes/mini-games before you make an actual
game. This allows you to evaluate concepts early and decide how they
feel/what they add to the game in general.

I think another important thing is the interaction between the asset
management and the development team is crucial. Using an internal wiki
as a design document might be suitable for a small game making
team. This might extend into a public wiki aswell which can help
players in the game.

Me and some friends will probably start working on a game sometime
soon, and we're currently discussing this a lot. I'll definitely
recall and reuse the idea about getting a head start and something
playable as soon as possible.
