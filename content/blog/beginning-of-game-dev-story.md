About a year ago, me and two classmates ([johntu](http://www.nada.kth.se/~johntu) & [dmol](http://www.nada.kth.se/~dmol))
participated in a programming competition called [Escape from
/dev/null](http://swdc.se/devnull/). The competition is based around having to program something
that assembles a client to a web-based API revolving different
things. The API gets further uncovered as you get further into the
competition. It's a game in a game. Very meta and
Oh-So-Lovely&trade; if you are into these kinds of things.

Back to the contest! As young and somewhat novice web programmers, little did we
know what to expect as we entered the contest. Not entirely without
effort, we smacked our heads together, right down in the free pizza, chunked
it down hard with some delicious beer and ended up at somewhere in the
order of second to last.

Needless to say, time passed and we participated in a few more
similar contests. The game we are building is in fact a client for
this particular game. Peter Svensson ([@psvensson](https://twitter.com/psvensson)) has made a fabulous
job of writing the game mechanics and providing it as a web service
for us to write a client from. We use web technologies in the core and
hope to deliver an exclusive fullscreen, WebGL experience to all of
our players. Are you getting excited? No? Then, maybe a bit
interested? Aha&#x2026; You continue reading because of pity and
self-recognition? Ah well, just wait until I tell you what the game is
about&#x2026;
