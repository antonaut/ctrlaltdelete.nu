This started out as a blog for written answers to assignments from a
course in Computer Game Design&nbsp;[^fn:1] at the Royal Institute of
Technology (KTH) in Sweden. Its purpose is to serve as a diary of
sorts. It is a place where I jot down ideas, thoughts and reflections
about my life and computers.

It is solemnly written by me, Anton Erholt. I am 28 years old and live
in Stockholm, Sweden. Currently I am on paternity leave with my son,
but otherwise I work as a Data engineer at Tele2 IoT.

Dear reader, hopefully it will be to your liking.
