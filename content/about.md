This started out as a blog for written answers to assignments from a
course in Computer Game Design&nbsp;[^fn:1] at the Royal Institute of
Technology (KTH) in Sweden. Its purpose is to serve as a diary of
sorts. It is a place where I jot down ideas, thoughts and reflections
about my life and computers.

It is solemnly written by me, Anton Erholt (twitter: [@aerholt](http://twitter.com/aerholt), github:
[@antonaut](https://github.com/antonaut/)). I am 28 years old and live in Stockholm, Sweden. Currently I am
working as a Data engineer at Tele2 IoT and finishing my master's
thesis.

This blog is in chronological order, with the oldest post at
bottom. Yes if you want to read it, you have to scroll. This may seem
a bit old-fashioned, but it is just the way I like it. I have started
using proper links as well and omitted the footnote style for the
newer posts.

Dear reader, hopefully it will be to your liking.
